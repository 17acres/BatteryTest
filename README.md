# Battery Test
Battery Test is a Java GUT application which interfaces with Jaguar motor controller over serial and provides multiple output waveforms and logging features for battery characterization and testing.The [BDC-COMM](http://content.vexrobotics.com/downloads/217-3367-VEXpro_Jaguar_BDC-COMM-107.zip) executable provided by VEX Robotics must be in the same directory of the jar file to function. The jaguar must be connected to the computer via a serial port (tested using a USB to serial adapter on Windows 10) to the left port. Log files will be output to %USERPROFILE%\Desktop\BattTest\. See [my website](http://dev.17acr.com/battery-test) for more information.
