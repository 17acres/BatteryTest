# Battery Test
NO LONGER UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT. FEEL FREE TO FORK

Battery Test is a Java GUI application which interfaces with black Jaguar motor controller over serial and provides multiple output waveforms and logging features for battery characterization and testing.The [BDC-COMM](http://content.vexrobotics.com/downloads/217-3367-VEXpro_Jaguar_BDC-COMM-107.zip) executable provided by VEX Robotics must be in the same directory of the jar file to function. The Jaguar must be connected to the computer via a serial port (tested using a USB to serial adapter on Windows 10) to the left jack. Log files will be output to `%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\BattTest\`. See [my website](https://www.17acr.com/2016/08/30/batttest.html) for more information.
